Hello i want to see if this test works i am not specifying what to add this time.
This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done.

> And this is how a quote looks.

Some [link](#) can also be shown.
